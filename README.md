# dice-game
A dice game that requires two players.
You roll the dice until you get 1, before you get 1 on your dice, make sure you hold your points. 
Rolling 1 or clicking holding button switches the active player to the other player.

This was a basic game for me to study and understand Javascript, especially DOM manupilation.
